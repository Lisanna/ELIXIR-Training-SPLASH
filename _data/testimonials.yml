    For the finetuning of our yearly training programme, TeSS is a valuable resource of inspiration. As a one stop shop for not-only European events and materials for life sciences training, I can get an overview of the recent offerings of many training providers via easy searches or faceted filters. This enables me to finetune our yearly training programme and identify potential external trainers for training sessions where we do not have internal experts. VIB Training provides its training events and training material to TeSS since more than 7 years.

    The ELIXIR-GOBLET train the trainer course is an excellent opportunity to up-skill myself to designing and developing better course syllabi and material as well as smoothen the delivery of my courses. I had the incredible opportunity to participate in the ELIXIR-GOBLET Train the Trainer course, and it has been a transformative experience for my career as an educator. The course seamlessly blends theory with practical application, providing a comprehensive understanding of effective training methodologies.
