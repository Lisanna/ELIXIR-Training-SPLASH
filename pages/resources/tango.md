  The Training Metrics Database was developed in an effort to streamline data collection, storage, and visualisation for the Quality and Impact Subtask of the ELIXIR Training Platform, which aims to:
  
    * Describe the audience demographic being reached by ELIXIR-badged training events
    * Assess the quality of ELIXIR-badged training events directly after they have taken place
    * Evaluate the longer term impact that ELIXIR-badged training events have had on the work of training participants.
