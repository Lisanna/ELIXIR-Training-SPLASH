## What are the pedagogical aspects?

When designing a training course, one should consider the Nicholls’ paradigm for curriculum development, more specifically:

define the learning outcomes based on the topics you have defined in your lesson plan.
For writing down the specific learning outcomes, you utilise the Bloom taxonomy.
KSA (Knowledge Skills Ability) that learners are able to demonstrate after instruction, the tangible evidence that learners have achieved.
define the learning experience which is any setting like lectures, games, exercise, ... in which learning takes place.
